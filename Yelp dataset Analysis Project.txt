Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
   SELECT count(*) FROM table 
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000 
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total number of distinct records for the primary keys in each of the tables listed below:
   SELECT count(DISTINCT key) FROM table
                     
i. Business =   id - 10000
ii. Hours =     business_id - 1562 
iii. Category = business_id - 2643 
iv. Attribute = business_id - 1115 
v. Review =     id - 10000 ,user_id - 9581 ,business_id - 8090 
vi. Checkin =   business_id - 493 
vii. Photo =    id 10000 ,business_id - 6493 
viii. Tip =     user_id - 537 ,business_id - 3979 
ix. User =      id - 10000 
x. Friend =     user_id - 11 
xi. Elite_years = user_id - 2780 

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
        
        Yes, In some cases review count increases the number of fans and it also depends on the date from which they are yelping.
        But also in case of Sara we can see more reviews but less fans. So, It is not always increasing.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, the two groups have different distribution of hours. 4-5 star groups have less hours then the 2-3 star groups.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes, 4-5 stars have more number of reviews then 2-3 hours in many cases.

         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

No, all the businesses have different postal codes.

SQL code used for analysis:

                SELECT B.name,
			   B.review_count,
			   H.hours,
			   postal_code,
			   CASE
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
			   END AS ord,
			   CASE
				  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
				  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
			   END AS star_rating
		FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H
		ON B.id = H.business_id
		INNER JOIN category C
		ON C.business_id = B.id
		WHERE (B.city == 'Toronto'
		AND
		C.category LIKE 'Restaurants')
		AND
		(B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3
		OR
		B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
		GROUP BY stars,ord
		ORDER BY ord,star_rating ASC

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
   Sum of review counts for business that is still open is much larger then then for the closed shops.
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
    Average stars for open shops is larger then that of the closed shops.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT is_open,count(*),sum(review_count),avg(stars)

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Analysis of the cities releationship with review counts and other attributes.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
It is clearly seen from the data that if we consider the most useful city the Las Vegas is leading then most other cities. The the attributes funny and cool are 
also related to the cities. 
The review count is also high in Las Vegas. And most cities with high reviews are open. And also the stars is around 3.5 - 4. 0 on average.
The latitudes and longitudes also says that the cities with high reviews are far from each other.                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
